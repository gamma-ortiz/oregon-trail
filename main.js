// Your task: Following the Class pattern (as shown above), create two different classes: a Traveler and a Wagon.

// The Traveler Class
// The Traveler class (blueprint) should set the following properties for each instance:

// a name, which must be provided as a parameter to the constructor.
// an amount of food, with an initial value of 1.
// an isHealthy property, with an initial value of true, which indicates whether a traveler is sick.
// The Traveler class should also have the following methods:

// hunt() â€“ Increases the traveler's food by 2.
// eat() â€“ Consumes 1 unit of the traveler's food. If the traveler doesn't have any food left to eat, the traveler is no longer healthy (set isHealthy to false).
// The Wagon Class
// The Wagon class should set the following properties for each instance:

// a capacity, which must be provided to the constructor: this is the maximum number of passengers a wagon can hold.
// a passengers list, which is initially an empty array.
// The Wagon class should have these methods:

// getAvailableSeatCount() â€“ Returns the number of empty seats, determined by the capacity set when the wagon was created, subtracted by the number of passengers currently on board.
// join(traveler) - Adds the traveler to the wagon if there is space. If the wagon is already at maximum capacity, don't add them.
// shouldQuarantine() - Returns true if there is at least one unhealthy person in the wagon. Return false if not.
// totalFood() - Returns the total amount of food among all passengers in the wagon.
// Testing
// Add the following code to the end of your program to verify that it is working properly â€“ or perhaps, add this to a tests.js file to load last in your index.html.

// Click to access the test code
// Stretch Goals
// Add the wagons and the travelers to the DOM.
// Display relevent information in the DOM about the wagons and traveler â€“ for example: travelers name/food/isHealthy, and/or Wagon's passengers/capacity.
// Add buttons to your classes â€“ for example: make a traveler eat, add a traveler to a wagon, check if a wagon should quarantine, etc.
// Add a button to create a new traveler based on a name the user inputs.
// Add animations simulating travel, etc.
// Generally just make your game feel more like the original Oregon Trail.
